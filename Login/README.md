# VERY Bad Java GUI

It's my try to make my first GUI in JAVA. Definitely not good.

## What is it

A GUI for a login page, it has a register page, a login page and a after login page. 

## Compiling

I made all this program in NetBeans IDE 12.4 and I compile with it as well. The main file is loginPage.java.

## "Usage"

Well... You cannot use it, it's not functional. It's just a GUI for a login page.
